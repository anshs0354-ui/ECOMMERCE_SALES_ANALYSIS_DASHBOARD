# E-commerce Sales Data Analysis (Power BI)

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing **e-commerce sales data** to gain actionable business insights using **Power BI**. An interactive dashboard was created to help track, monitor, and analyze online sales performance across different dimensions such as products, categories, customers, and time.

The analysis is based on two CSV files:

* **Orders** – contains order-level information
* 
* **Order Details** – contains product-level transaction details

The dashboard enables data-driven decision-making by presenting key metrics in a clear and visually engaging way.
